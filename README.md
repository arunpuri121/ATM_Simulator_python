<h1>ATM_Simulator_python</h1>
this is an atm simulator. the codes are written based on python programming language.

<h3>PIN for the atm simulator - 1234</h3>

To make this atm simulator we have made a class and have used a constructor to intialise the current balance to 10000 and have set the pin to 1234, there are some several methods are being made in the class to perform the several task in the atm_simulation machine i.e - check_balance, withdrwal, deposit and exit.

Once the class is made a function is being made to perform the logic, taking input from the user to perform the task as per the user needs and further from these input, conditions are being put up in the code to make the logic working and the desired results can be printed as per the user requirement without breaking the logic of the code.

Now, after making the class and funtion, the class is called and an object is made with the help of that class and that object has been passed to the function so that the atm simulator can work flawlessly with out any errors.
